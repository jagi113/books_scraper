# Books scraper

This is a simple app that scrapes info about books sold at www.pantarhei.sk.
By default it scrapes only first five pages.

By running run.py file you will get users menu, where you can 
- list books by title
- list books by author
- list books by price
- search books by title or an author
- show details of next book

It is not database based. Scraping is done in real-time, so it takes some time to load books info.
